I worked for this innovative publishing company and helped to modernize and
build up their print-on-demand services.  I introduced more efficient workflows
and automated procedures for pre-print file handling, production planning, and
material ordering.  With my help, the company was able to further its mission
of republishing obscure and significant works, and expand the infrastructure as
a printer which made that possible.
