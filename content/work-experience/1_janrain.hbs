I was hired on as a "WordPress expert" to design, build out, and maintain the
company's existing marketing and documentation sites. While at Janrain, I built
a number of new demos and did a ground-up redesign of the company's UI
framework. I was hoping to be able to put some of my ideas into practice by
improving the various platform extensions the company offers (WordPress, Drupal,
and Magento plugins, and standalone Javascript widgets), but I've been kept too
busy working on all the marketing creatives and microsites to really apply
myself there.
