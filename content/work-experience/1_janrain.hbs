I was hired as a WordPress expert to design, build out, and maintain the
company's existing marketing and documentation sites. I also filled the role of
a general front-end developer, built product demos and did a ground-up redesign
of the company's UI framework.

I joined the company during a time of rapid expansion, expecting to be able
to devote some time to improving the various open-source platform extensions the
company offers (WordPress, Drupal, and Magento plugins, and standalone
Javascript widgets). Since that point, however, the company has downsized
substantially, and I've been too busy as one of the few front-end developers
there to really achieve these goals.
