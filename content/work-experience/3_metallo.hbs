I initially worked on contract for this kitchen and appliance design startup,
designing and building the web app which was used to showcase and market the
company's line of products.  After the company launched, I joined full-time as
the all-around creative and digital design specialist.  I was responsible for
overseeing project designs, from concept sketches to CAD drawings and
pre-production plans. I also built and maintained the company's websites,
promotional literature, and marketing collateral.
