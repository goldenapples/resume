I jumped full-time into freelance design/development work around 2007, when the
company I was working for at the time went under. I started out with a pretty
solid grounding in design for print, books, posters, and logos, but taught
myself enough PHP and Javascript to focus on building websites. I specialized
primarily in mid-size WordPress sites, but stayed active enough with other
technologies to remain familar and comfortable working in other web fields.
