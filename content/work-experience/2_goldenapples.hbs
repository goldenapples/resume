I have been doing small freelance design/development projects since around
2003. I jumped into full-time freelance work in September 2007, when the
company I was working for at the time shut down. I started out with a solid
grounding in graphic and print design, and took on several book publishers as
clients. After teaching myself enough PHP and Javascript to be comfortable
building websites, I branched into web design and publishing. My specialty was
mid-sized WordPress projects and sinple-page Javascript apps.  I built and
maintained two plugins in the WordPress plugin repository and an Android app in
the Google Play marketplace.
