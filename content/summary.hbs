title: Summary Of Experience
---

I've been involved with publishing for most of my life.
As a teenager I ran a BBS overnight on my 300 baud modem and put out xeroxed
fanzines, and I've always been passionate about learning the technology
surrounding and enabling communication. I've published books, newspapers, and
websites of my own for fifteen years, and worked in printing, publishing and
the web for most of my life.

I am an all-around developer with experience in everything from front-end
design and development to database optimization to shell scripting. I am always
working to hone my skills and understand new technology, and I have never shied
away from a challenge that involved learning new skills. I have built and
maintained WordPress sites and plugins for over eight years, and know the
internals of WordPress thoroughly.
