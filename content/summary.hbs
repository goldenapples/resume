title: Summary Of Experience
---

I've been involved with publishing in one form or another for most of my life
since putting out xeroxed fanzines as a teenager, and I've always been
passionate about learning the technology surrounding and enabling communication.
I have built and maintained WordPress sites and plugins for over eight years,
and know the internals of WordPress pretty thoroughly.

I am an all-around developer with experience in nearly all aspects of the web,
from front-end design and development to shell scripting, and I have never
shied away from a challenge that involved learning new skills, or stopped
trying to improve my skills and learn new things.
