COLOPHON
============================================================

Built by Nathaniel Taintor, (c) 2013

All details of how to build this file can be found in the repository at
https://github.com/goldenapples/resume . This uses text files and YAML config
files to build a single page HTML resume, using a grunt build task.

If you use this, I'd love to see how. Feel free to fork the original repo and
share improvements back.
